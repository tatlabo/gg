            „Małgorzata Gajewska is a committed artist, modern in her concepts, who deals with unpopular and difficult subjects.
            However, these topics have a deeper, social meaning. The path that she consistently follows brings together
            specialist knowledge (the roots of the Bauhas concept) with an understanding of contemporary atomization of society
            and a deep faith in the sense of design that changes the environment by changing the world.” (prof. M.Garda)
